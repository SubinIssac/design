                <p class="p-content">Airports are vital national resources. They serve a key role in transportation of people and goods and in regional, national, and international commerce. They are
                    where the nation’s aviation system connects with other modes of transportation and where federal responsibility for managing and regulating air traffic operations
                    intersects with the role of state and local governments that own and operate most airports. The smart phone, in particular, offers great potential to help the
                    passenger customize the airport experience while at the same time reducing the stress associated with airports and travel. Improving the Customer Experience new
                    and Innovative Technologies presents an overview of how technology is being used to provide critical information, new services, operational efficiencies, and twoway communication tools to passengers while giving passengers unprecedented control over their experience at the airport.

                <p class="p-content">Passenger trends have changed since the adoption of smart phone and mobile technologies. In 2014, the airline telecommunications service reported in its
Passenger IT Trends Survey that mobile device adoption among passengers is at a high point, with 81% of passengers carrying a smart phone, 43% carrying a laptop,
43% carrying a tablet, and 18% carrying all three devices (SITA, June 2014). The 2015 SITA’s 360-degree report noted that globally, 97% of passengers bring a mobile
device with them on trips. Technology has transformed the way passengers experience the airport terminal (SITA 2015). A wide variety of self-service technologies
have been implemented in many U.S. airports, including self–bag tagging, self–check-in, and self–gate boarding. Due to different security protocols, some airports
abroad are more advanced in implementing automated bag-drop stations, home-printed bag tags, and 100% self-service passenger terminals to take full advantage
of passing control of the check-in process to customers

Mobile apps can send push notifications that appear on the smart-phone screen and, when permitted by the user, push notifications can be sent based
on location. Mobile apps offer the best opportunity to employ loyalty programs and learn about the preferences of the user. An app offers greater ease
of use and functionality than a mobile website
