                <p class="p-content">Airports are vital national resources. They serve a key role in transportation of
                    people and goods and in regional, national, and international commerce. They are
                    where the nationâ€™s aviation system connects with other modes of transportation and where federal
                    responsibility for managing and regulating air traffic operations
                    intersects with the role of state and local governments that own and operate most airports. The
                    smart phone, in particular, offers great potential to help the
                    passenger customize the airport experience while at the same time reducing the stress associated
                    with airports and travel. Improving the Customer Experience new
                    and Innovative Technologies presents an overview of how technology is being used to provide critical
                    information, new services, operational efficiencies, and twoway communication tools to passengers
                    while giving passengers unprecedented control over their experience at the airport.

                <p class="p-content">Passenger trends have changed since the adoption of smart phone and mobile
                    technologies. In 2014, the airline telecommunications service reported in its
                    Passenger IT Trends Survey that mobile device adoption among passengers is at a high point, with 81%
                    of passengers carrying a smart phone, 43% carrying a laptop,
                    43% carrying a tablet, and 18% carrying all three devices (SITA, June 2014). The 2015 SITAâ€™s
                    360-degree report noted that globally, 97% of passengers bring a mobile
                    device with them on trips. Technology has transformed the way passengers experience the airport
                    terminal (SITA 2015). A wide variety of self-service technologies
                    have been implemented in many U.S. airports, including selfâ€“bag tagging, selfâ€“check-in, and
                    selfâ€“gate boarding. Due to different security protocols, some airports
                    abroad are more advanced in implementing automated bag-drop stations, home-printed bag tags, and
                    100% self-service passenger terminals to take full advantage
                    of passing control of the check-in process to customers

                    have been implemented in many U.S. airports, including selfâ€“bag tagging, selfâ€“check-in, and
                    selfâ€“gate boarding. Due to different security protocols, some airports
                    abroad are more advanced in implementing automated bag-drop stations, home-printed bag tags, and
                    100% self-service passenger terminals to take full advantage
                    of passing control of the check-in process to customers

                    (SITA) reported in its Passenger IT Trends Survey that mobile device adoption among passengers is at
                    a high point, with 81% of passengers carrying a
                    smart phone, 43% carrying a laptop, 43% carrying a tablet, and 18% carrying all three devices (SITA,
                    June 2014). The 2015 SITAâ€™s 360-degree report
                    noted that globally, 97% of passengers bring a mobile device with them on trips. Technology has
                    transformed the way passengers experience the airport
                    terminal (SITA 2015)
                    An app offers greater control over the user experience and is better for building customer loyalty
                    and a personal relationship

                    Mobile apps can send push notifications that appear on the smart-phone screen and, when permitted by
                    the user, push notifications can be sent based
                    on location. Mobile apps offer the best opportunity to employ loyalty programs and learn about the
                    preferences of the user. An app offers greater ease
                    of use and functionality than a mobile website
