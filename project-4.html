                    Etihad Airways, a renowned international airline, embarked on a project to introduce "Etihad Credit," an innovative initiative aimed at providing greater flexibility and convenience to its guests. The core idea behind Etihad Credit was to offer travelers the freedom to adjust their travel plans by allowing free cancellations and, in return, providing the original booking value as credit for future trips.

                    This project was a strategic response to the evolving travel landscape, acknowledging the need for adaptability and peace of mind for passengers.

                            <h5 class="font-weight-bold text-left">The Findings</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Travel can be unpredictable, and passengers may face circumstances that necessitate changes to their itineraries. Vouchers offer a safety net by ensuring that the value of their original bookings is preserved as travel credits. This helps travelers feel more secure and less hesitant when making reservations, knowing they have an option to reschedule or use the credit for future trips.</li>
                                 <li>Airlines like Etihad Airways aim to build strong customer relationships and encourage loyalty. By providing vouchers as an option for canceled or delayed flights, they demonstrate a commitment to customer satisfaction. This can lead to higher customer retention rates, as passengers are more likely to choose an airline that offers such flexibility.</li>
                                 <li>Vouchers can also benefit airlines by reducing the financial impact of refund requests. Instead of issuing full refunds for canceled flights, airlines can offer vouchers, which may result in lower immediate cash outflows. </li>   
                                 <li>In a competitive airline industry, offering vouchers as part of a comprehensive customer service strategy can serve as a unique selling point. Travelers are more inclined to choose airlines that provide them with options and solutions when their plans change unexpectedly.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                              <li>How frequently do you travel with Etihad Airways or other airlines that offer similar credit systems?</li>
                                  <li>Can you describe a recent experience where you had to change or cancel a flight booking with Etihad Airways?</li>

                                      <li>Are you aware of airlines that offer flexible booking options that allow changes or cancellations with minimal fees?</li>

                              <li>If you are aware of such options, have you ever used them for a future flight booking?</li>
                              <li>If you haven't used them, what factors or concerns have prevented you from doing so?</li>
                              <li>What aspects of flexible booking options do you find most convenient and user-friendly?</li>
                              <li>Conversely, have you encountered any challenges or areas of improvement when making changes to your travel plans?</li>

                              <li>Is there anything else you'd like to share regarding your experiences with airline booking and flexibility, especially related to changes or cancellations?</li> 
                          </ul>
                          <h5 class="font-weight-bold text-left">Pain points</h5>
                          <ul>
                          <li>Many travelers encounter the need to change or cancel their flight bookings, often due to unforeseen circumstances, which can be disruptive and inconvenient.</li>
                          <li>The uncertainty of future plans can lead to anxiety, as travelers may hesitate to make reservations, fearing that changes may incur additional fees.</li>
                          <li>Complex Voucher Redemption: The process of redeeming vouchers for future travel can sometimes involve navigating through complex procedures, potentially causing confusion or frustration for travelers.</li>

                          <li>Limited Awareness: Some travelers may not be fully aware of the voucher programs offered by airlines in response to canceled or delayed flights, potentially missing out on the benefits.</li>
                          <li>Hesitation to Use Vouchers: Even when aware, travelers may be hesitant to use vouchers due to concerns about their eligibility, expiration dates, or the associated redemption processes.</li>
                          <li>Complicated Redemption: Travelers often find the process of redeeming vouchers to be complicated or time-consuming, impacting their overall experience and potentially discouraging them from using their travel credits.</li>
                          <li>Inconvenience: The inconvenience of managing vouchers, coupled with concerns about their terms and conditions, can deter travelers from taking advantage of these programs and the flexibility they offer.</li>
                          <li>Desire for Simplicity: Travelers prefer a simple and straightforward process for redeeming vouchers to reduce stress and confusion when making changes to their travel plans.</li>
                          <li>Transparency and Information: Clear information about the terms and conditions of voucher programs is essential to build trust and encourage their use.</li>
                          <li>Value for Loyalty: Travelers value airlines that offer vouchers as part of their loyalty program, making them more likely to choose such carriers in the future, provided the redemption process is user-friendly.</li>
                        </ul>
